Use this file to briefly describe your project's data.

These directories are meant to be organized as follows:

- `external`: Store data that you obtained from outside the repo, meaning that
  they cannot be regenerated by the code contained in the repo. These data
  should be committed. If you external data is too large consider to store 
  them in a database or in an external data repository, Github LFS might 
  be an alternative. The data stored in the external repository should always be 
  accommodated by a data codebook.
- `generated`: These are derivative data that are generated by running the code 
  within the repo. A codebook might be nice if you expect users to work with
  the data without working through your code but not strictly required.
- `pulled`: This is where you store data that your repo code pulls from external
  sources. Most of the time a data codebook won't be necessary as the external
  sources will provide documentation.
  
Obviously, you can use more descriptive folder names as you see fit. But we 
encourage you to always separate external data from code generated data and to 
only commit data that cannot be code generated. An exception could be made on 
cases where generating the data takes substantial time and the resulting dataset 
is relatively small.

Following this approach, the folders `pulled` and `generated` contain a 
`.gitignore` file that prevents accidental committing of generated data.
